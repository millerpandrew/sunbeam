# sunbeam
A repository for the Sunbeam programming language, which I wrote as the final project for EECS 483 (Compiler Construction)

Example programs can be found in the "Examples" folder. Example programs mainly showcase string functionality, range based indexing, and error handling. Additional test cases used for this language are available upon request.
